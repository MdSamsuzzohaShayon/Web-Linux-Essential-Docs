   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx -y
   ```
 - Allowing HTTPS Through the Firewall (We did it previously - check once again)
   ```
   sudo ufw status
   # IF IT IS DISABLE - ENABLE ONCE AGAIN
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
   sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'
   ```
 - Now obtain ssl certificate
   ```
   sudo certbot --nginx -d somedomain.com -d www.somedomain.com
   # IT WILL ASK FOR EMAIL ADDRESS ENT THAT 
   # A FOR AGREE
   # Choose redirect (2)
   ```

## Advantages of a Linux server or a Windows server

Linux open source servers are easier to use. Some of the key benefits of a Linux server are:

 - Cost savings. Open-source systems such as Linux are available to the public, which means the web hosting company only needs to pay for the technical support to install and maintain it. The technical support costs are normally spread among all the web-hosting clients, so the cost that is passed onto the client company is relatively small. With Windows, typically the company using the Windows servers either pays for the operating system or pays a periodic software license.
 - Access to open source applications. As with most technology, though, applications work better with similarly designed applications. This means a company using a Linux server should be able to seamlessly use open-source software. Using a Linux server with Windows applications is possible, but an extra layer of work to interface between the open-source technology and Windows for-profit technology will be required.
 - More reliable. Linux and open-source software generally use fewer resources, making the system the more efficient.
 - Easier to modify. Linux servers and software can be modified on the fly. Modifications to Windows products generally require waiting for a new version of the server to be released.

## Benefits of Windows servers over Linux servers

Windows servers are more robust systems. They differ from Linux servers in the following ways:

 - Better support. While Windows servers and Windows applications come with a cost, they also both usually come with paid support. With open-source software, the business client and the web-hosting company usually have to pay technical experts who understand open-source software. The other alternative is to rely on community support, which can be timely. Often, too, community members can’t answer your particular questions.
 - Better integration with Microsoft products. Windows applications are designed to integrate with Windows servers, which makes Windows servers more valuable than Linux – if the business client likes its Windows Software. For large companies that need to run Microsoft SQL and Microsoft Access, two popular databases, a Windows server may be the only option. Microsoft Access is typically used for desktop environments, while Microsoft SQL is normally used in a cluster hosting environment.
 - More complete. Windows servers and software generally have more features, more bells and whistles, than open-source software does.
 - Remote desktop access. Linux servers are command-line based. Windows servers come with a Remote Desktop, which is an easier way to manage a server because it comes with a graphical user interface.
 - Scripting frameworks. These frameworks, such as ASP and ASP.Net, are easier to install and manage and have better support than Linux scripting frameworks. ASP is the predecessor to ASP.NET. Scripts and web pages developed using one of these two Microsoft frameworks will normally only work on a Windows server.

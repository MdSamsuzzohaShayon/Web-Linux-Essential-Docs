 - What is BIOS and UEFI? [Deferances](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/uefi-vs-bios/).
    - BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a computer's microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it is    powered on. It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices, such as the hard disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.
    - UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It does the same job as a BIOS, but with one basic difference: it stores all data about initialization and startup in an .efi file, instead of storing it on the firmware. all modern computers come equipped with UEFI by default. 
 - What is GRUB in Linux? GRUB vs GRUB2.
 - GRUB is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process. It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions. A bootloader is the first software that runs when a computer starts. It loads the kernel of the operating system and then the kernel initializes the rest of the operating system: shell, display manager, desktop environment, etc.

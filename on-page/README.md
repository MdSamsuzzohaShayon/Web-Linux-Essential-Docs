# On Page SEO

 - When we search on google -> google give the result (include heading, short description, url)
 - they take that heading from *web page title*

 - title tag should be 50 to 60 character long
 - description should be under 156 character long -> and should contain primary keyword
 - URL needs to explain what the website is about -> It should be easy to understand and tell search engine and human.
 - URL should be under 155 character -> but the shorter the url the better for example:-

 __https://domainname.com__
 __https://domainname.com/blog/title-of-the-post__

 - Others Meta Tags - meta keywords attribute - a series of keywords you deem relevant to the page in question.
 - Meta view-port - give the browser instruction on how to control the page's dimensions and scrolling
 - Meta charset - defines a character set.
 - meta author - define the author of the page
 Favicon - the main reason your website should have a favicon icon is improving user experience -> It is much easier to find the needed bookmark by image. Associated with a certain website, rather than looking though different URL.
 - Convert favicon in different format using [freefavicon](https://www.freefavicon.com/)
 - Images - if you're posting an image in your content, you must compress it. -> images are one of the big causes of a slow website.
 - Attributes - alt tags also play a role in seo, alt tags help search engine associate images with a web-page's content so they can properly index it within their search result.
 - The test of the title attribute is displayed as a tool-tip in most browser - it appears in a small bubble when the cursor hovers over the link. it also serves a purpose for seo.
 - Mobile responsive - having a mobile-friendly website is a critical part of your online presence. in many countries, smartphone traffic now exceeds desktop traffic.
 - Minify and compress - when you minify your website's css, html and javascript file you can save some valuable time off of your site's page load speed.
 - keyword usage - keywords must appear in title, meta description and headings, as well as placing the main keyword of the page in heading and sub-heading. it's best practice to squeese it into the opening paragraph also.

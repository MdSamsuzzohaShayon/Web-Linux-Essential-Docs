# File Servers

They are often responsible for the availability of stored files and their management as well as security. You can send and receive files at the user’s request. These are not like sharing servers; they are more like the filing cabinets of the Internet world.

File servers are often categorized by how the files on the server are accessed. Here are the different methods:

## Internet File Servers:

 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
 - HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

## LAN File Servers:

 - SMB/CIFS Protocol
 - NFS Protocol
